# BlackJack

Simple Blackjack game. Here we have computer - dealer and human player at the keyboard with deck of 52 cards. Player has a bank roll, from which he can place a bet. Dealer starts with 1 card face up and 1 card face down. Player starts with 2 cards face up. Player goes first, his goal is to get to value of 21 before the dealer does, he can only receive another card (Hit) or stop receiving cards (Stay). If player keeps hitting and goes over 21, they bust and lost the bet, game is over then and money goes to the dealer. If player is under 21, dealer hits until player is beaten or the dealer busts.
